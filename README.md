This repository hosts a sports-themed HTML and CSS project developed during an internship. The project centers on a football-themed website featuring sections for the homepage with team introduction and dynamic visuals, a schedule displaying upcoming matches, a player section with a carousel showcasing team members, a league table showing standings, a gallery of team photos, and contact information. It serves to demonstrate proficiency in web development and design, specifically tailored to a football theme.
